# Memory Game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches:
    - A message below the grid notifies you;
    - You get +1 to your score;
    - These cards then stay "flipped"
- If the next card you flip does not match, or is at the same position of your previous flip:
    - A message below the grid notifies you
    - The cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
